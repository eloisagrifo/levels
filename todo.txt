In rightApproximation:
-- FIXME: Use DegreeLimit in Hom to only compute degree 0 parts (DegreeLimit is newish)




E:

--explain what mapwithvars and degreeij do
--double check that the code killed in supportVarieties (from supportMatrices) can die
And check exts

--add documentation + comments to supportMatrices

isBuilt: change how supports are computed to use supportVariety


Push forward switch everywhere and kill our restrict


Does extKoszul actually work?
